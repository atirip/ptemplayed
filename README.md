# ptemplayed.js

My fork of  https://github.com/archan937/templayed.js which seems to be abandoned

- added support to AMD and Node require. 
- changed #/^ implementation from explicit Boolean (true/false) to truthy/falsy
- allowed functions as properties everywhere (f.e in {{#foo}}{{/foo}} foo can be function)
